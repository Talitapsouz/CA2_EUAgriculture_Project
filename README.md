# DATA ANALYSIS



# LIBRARIES 

To complete the analysis required in a Jupyter notebook, you can use a variety of Python tools and libraries. Some options for performing data analysis in Python include:

NumPy: a library for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of numerical data.

pandas: a library for working with tabular data, such as data stored in a spreadsheet or a CSV file. pandas provides functions for reading, manipulating, and analyzing data.

matplotlib: a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

seaborn: a library for creating statistical visualizations in Python, built on top of matplotlib.

scikit-learn: a library for machine learning in Python, including functions for training and evaluating models, and for preprocessing and transforming data.

You can use these tools and libraries in a Jupyter notebook by importing them into your notebook and using the functions and methods they provide. For example, you could use pandas to read in a CSV file and use NumPy to perform calculations on the data, or use matplotlib to create a visualization of the data.
